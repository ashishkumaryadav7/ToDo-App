# To-Do App

## Project Description

I have created a To-Do App using React.js to help manage your tasks efficiently. This app leverages Bootstrap for responsiveness, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. The application is meticulously divided into components for better maintainability and scalability.

## Features

1. **Task Creation with Timestamp:**
   - Every time you create a new to-do item, the app records and displays the creation time and date, allowing you to keep track of when each task was added.

2. **Edit Functionality:**
   - Entered something wrong? No problem! You can edit any task. When a task is edited, an "Edited" label, similar to WhatsApp, appears to indicate the modification.

3. **Completion Marking:**
   - Once a task is completed, you can mark it as "Done" using the tick button. This action changes the background color of the task and displays a "Done" label. Additionally, the edit button is removed, ensuring that completed tasks cannot be altered.

4. **Task Deletion:**
   - You have the freedom to delete any task at any time with the delete button, allowing you to keep your task list clean and organized.

## Components

The app is organized into multiple components, each responsible for specific functionalities, ensuring a modular and easy-to-manage codebase.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** For building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive design and styling.
